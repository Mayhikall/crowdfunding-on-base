NEXT_PUBLIC_TOKEN_ADDRESS=deployed_token_address
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=84532
```

## 💻 Usage

### Running Tests

```bash
cd contracts
forge test
```

Run tests with verbosity:

```bash
forge test -vvv
```

### Deploying Contracts

cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Interacting with Contracts

**Creating a Campaign:**

```solidity
// Example: Create a charity campaign accepting ETH
crowdfunding.createCampaign(
    "Help Build a School",           // title
    "Building schools in rural...",  // description
    1 ether,                          // target amount
    30 days,                          // duration
    "QmImageCID...",                  // IPFS image CID
    PaymentType.ETH,                  // payment type
    Category.CHARITY                  // category
);
```

**Donating to a Campaign:**

```solidity
// Donate ETH (minimum 0.001 ETH)
crowdfunding.donateETH{value: 0.1 ether}(campaignId);

// Donate tokens (minimum 1 SDT)
token.approve(address(crowdfunding), amount);
crowdfunding.donateToken(campaignId, amount);
```

**Claiming Faucet Tokens:**

```solidity
// Claim 100 SDT (24-hour cooldown)
sedulurToken.claimFaucet();
```
